 * The camera is connected to the robot controller through a Wi-Fi bridge

 * by the robot controller - namely, to operate the camera - and then
 * sends the data it receives back through the Wi-Fi bridge to the robot
 * controller.
 * 
 * The robot controller communicates with the Arduino through this class.
